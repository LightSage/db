update_notes: '<p><em><a href="https://homestarrunner.com/sbemails/207-too-cool" rel="nofollow">♪
  Let''s not make a big deal outta this... it''s just a little Trogdor update ♪</a></em></p>

  <p>Just fixing a few things that have been bugging me:</p>

  <h3>Quality of Life Improvements</h3>

  <ul>

  <li><strong>You can now exit a game by pressing Select</strong> instead of A+Select

  <ul>

  <li>The original combination was intentionally complicated to prevent players from
  accidentally quitting and losing their progress, but with autosave, that''s no longer
  necessary</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  <li><strong>Overlay setting is now saved</strong>, and it has a new menu option
  in Cosmetic settings

  <ul>

  <li>You can still change it via button input, as well</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  <li>Fixed a very small menu bug</li>

  <li>Minor text polish</li>

  <li>[PC] <strong>Fullscreen setting is now saved</strong></li>

  <li>[Wii U] <strong>Resolution increased</strong> from 720p to 1080p

  <ul>

  <li>By extension, this means an additional scaling option has been added</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  <li>[Wii] Minor Gamecube controller polish for consistency with Gamecube version</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Technical Changes</h3>

  <ul>

  <li>[PC] <del>DLLs are now statically linked so they no longer bloat the game directory;
  <strong>it''s just an EXE and audio</strong></del> <strong>UPDATE: Reverted as of
  8/23/24</strong>

  <ul>

  <li>Additionally, the non-Visual Studio Windows makefile actually works now, and
  there''s a new x86 makefile to go with it</li>

  <li>If you want to compile it yourself, Visual Studio is still an option</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  <li>[Other] Scaling options are now frozen/unfrozen based on display resolution
  instead of being hardcoded per-system

  <ul>

  <li>This doesn''t affect current releases, but it does make scaling options one
  less thing to worry about when porting to other systems</li>

  <li>PC still allows all options regardless of display because of windowed mode</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  </ul>

  <p>Enjoy!</p>

  <p><strong>UPDATE 8/23/24</strong>: Reverted statically linked DLLs in Windows releases;
  not all DLLs were static as I had originally thought, so the game wouldn''t run
  on some machines.</p>'
